Modeled after Minoru Nomata's *Babel* collection of imaginary tower designs, each floor of the tower is a maze that is generated using a randomized variation of the Growing Tree algorithm (i.e. Prim-Jarnik algorithm) and is connected with other floors via stair prefabs that are rendered at the end of each maze.
